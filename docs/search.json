For our methods, our necessary data included ENSO data from Oceanic Nino Index (ONI), precipitation data in the form of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) from drought.gov and Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) from US drought monitor. Our Rstudio packages we utilized for our data analysis included; “here”, “readxl”, “dplyr”, “tidyr”, “ggplot2”, and “scales”. Lastly, we used Rstudio and Quarto to create and report generation of our project."
